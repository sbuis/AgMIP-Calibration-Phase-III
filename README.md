# AgMIP-Calibration-Phase-II

This repository has been created to gather useful functions, examples and possibly data for participants of the AgMIP Calibration Phase III protocol who will use the CroptimizR R package. 

It contains:

* AgMIP-Calibration-Phase-II.Rproj, the R project. Open it in RStudio before working on your application.
* main_script.R a template to be filled for the application of the AgMIP calibration phase II protocol on your own model and configuration. To use it you need a model wrapper for the CroptimizR package for your model (refer to the [Guidelines for implementing a crop model R wrapper for CroptimizR](https://sticsrpacks.github.io/CroptimizR/articles/Designing_a_model_wrapper.html)).
* R folder: contains functions used in main_script.R
